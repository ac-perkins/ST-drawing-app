# Social Tables Front End Intern Challenge
Thanks for your interest in the Social Tables Intern Program! 

Social Tables engineering is looking for an intern!  The position is a great opportunity to learn and grow on a fantastic team working with fun, exciting tech. Your task, should you choose to accept it, is to build out some features for a React/Redux drawing app. Women, LGBTQ+ and people of color are encouraged to apply!

## The App
The app is a React/Redux app which lets you draw on a `<canvas>` element with different brush sizes.

## The Challenge

We need to make our drawing app more fun!
Given a tool & brush size selector, build as many of these additional components as you can:
* Colorpicker: a component that lets you pick a color to draw. The built in HTML color input will be fine here.
* Image stamp: a place for you to upload an image and pop it in the drawing area like so. The image stamp component should give you a preview of the image uploaded. It should function like this: ![Image Stamp Tool](/public/img/stamp.gif?raw=true "Image Stamp Tool")
* Eraser: a tool to erase what you've drawn. Hint: there is a particular color that makes for a great eraser.
* Reset: a button that wipes the entire canvas clean so you can make a new drawing.
* Save: a button that will take what you've drawn in the canvas and open it as an image in another tab so you can save it.

Also you'll need to style the sidebar so it looks as close to this image as possible. **Clean, maintainable, and organized (S)CSS is an important part of your submission!**

It only needs to work in the latest Chrome & Firefox.

## How to submit
Send all your files in one email to internchallenge@socialtables.com with the subject line, Social Tables Venue Mapper Intern Challenge.

You must include the following files in your email: YourInitials-readme.{md, txt}, YourInitials-code.{tar.gz, zip}, YourInitials-resume.pdf (where YourInitials are your initials).

These files will contain:

* The YourInitials-readme.{md, txt} contains instructions for running your code and any notes you wish to include.
* The YourInitials-code.{tar.gz, zip} contains your code. You can optionally also submit a link to your code in the readme file.
* A file named YourInitials-resume.pdf containing your resume.

Submitting your node-modules folder isn't necessary, for example, because we can get it by running npm install; however, you should at least submit any files you found necessary to change and enough support and explanation so we can reproduce your results. In any case, include all the information in YourInitials-readme.{md, txt}.

## Getting started

After running `npm install`, you can run these commands in the root directory to start the project

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>

## FAQ

**Can I copy code from the Internet?**  
You must cite any outside resources you use in your work (for example, using comments to denote a snippet obtained from Stack Overflow).  

**Can I post my solution to the Internet/GitHub?**  
We ask that you don't. It makes it much harder to evaluate submissions when a completed solution is available for review.

**Can I copy someone else's submission, cite it, and submit?**  
No.

**Can I submit without completing all the challenge?**  
Absolutely! Do as much as you can.

**What is the status of my application?**  
Email <internchallenge@socialtables.com>.

**I still have a question.**
